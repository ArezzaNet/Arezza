**Volt Logistics** integrates transaction-based energy services and controls with Energy Fees designed around a pay per kWh program, long-term equipment and maintenance leases of CHP and demand-energy-response DER systems; equipment suppliers provide long-term maintenance and parts replacement programs.

**energy management for small and medium-sized buildings**

*Transactions* are negotiated exchanges of products, services and rights enabling value allocations and implementing strategies that increase efficiency levels and improve resource allocation;

*Building Controls and Algorithms* are part of retrofits in existing buildings, resulting in energy savings over time through improved operations and maintenance.

*Market Services* support the efficient utilization of resources and assets by helping customers modify their energy consumption behavior through mechanisms such as time-of-use and real-time pricing.

**understanding water use and identifying savings opportunities**

*Conservation* the true cost of water in a property should be measured as the water rate + the sewer rate multiplied by the water consumption volume + plus fees and other associated costs. In addition, while the water usage profile varies by building type and use, mechanical systems account for 30 percent of water use in a typical building, with cooling towers nearly 50 percent and outdoor usage another 20-30 percent.

**water heating accounts for 8 percent of energy consumption in commercial buildings**

*The Cost of Water* is deceptively low as building owners and tenants pay for water twice; water supplied + water discharged to the sewer. Additional considerations include the cost of energy required to pump and heat water and rate increases over time from energy and water utilities. 

*Technologies* for reducing water use include control technologies that measure the moisture in the soil and tailor the irrigation schedule accordingly, rain sensors and rainfall shut-off devices that turn off irrigation on rainy days, and rotary spray sprinkler heads that lose less water to evaporation.
