### _**Working Locally and Globally to Create New Opportunities**_

**Tema** implements projects in small towns, main streets and historic districts that focus on travel, logistics, energy efficiency and water conservation in museums, breweries, vineyards/wineries, hotels and other accommodation venues visited by our travel clients.

_**Traveling Clients**_ are interested in historic preservation, architecture, gastronomy, wine and brew tastings events, the outdoors, local farm practices as well as energy efficiency, transit land and water conservation practices. Tema makes payments to local service providers at cost with no mark-ups for booking accommodations, sightseeing and other event entry fees as well as lunches and dinners. Alternatively, the client pays the service provider directly based on instructions from Tema.
Our Clients typically visit and participate in professional enrichment programs at local events, seminars and other learning experiences. Travel programs are designed to cover multiple regions of the United States.
