### **_Family Vacations Groups Travel and Business Trips_**

**As an American** who has lived, studied and worked in countries around the world, I feel it is important that visitors to the United States experience a full range of opportunities, from our nation's capital, to the large ethnic cities of the East Coast and Midwest, Southern hospitality, as well as American Diversity, Western and Native Heritage. I am especially interested in showing off our various cuisines, wineries and breweries and achievements in our communities, ranging from land conservation management, to renewable energy, local public transit initiatives, water resources management and especially America’s unique entrepreneurial spirit. _John Leboffe_

_**Culture and Travel**_

**_Tourism is Best Experienced in the Company of Local Friends and Experts_** Tourism is one of the largest industries in the world economy; right up there with real estate, automobiles and financial services. It is also highly segmented: business travel, conventions and meetings, cruises, family vacations, food and wine travel, responsible, sustainable, ethical, and more.

**Cultural Tourism** assumes uniquely local dimensions wherever you go; the activities that you, the local or global visitor, select and, irrespective of the length of your stay, are unique of the community you are visiting and rooted into the local economy, culture and traditions.

**How to Travel Culturally!** is a very much function of the destination you choose. Your visit to a country, region or town is personalized as a function of your interests and preferences: _When in Rome…._ To engage in cultural tourism means doing and going where the locals go. Many destinations are known for the negative effects travel has on the local culture and environment, especially during certain periods of the year.

_**Travel is Best Planned & Managed by Those with Knowledge of Your Community and the Locations You Visit**_

**Tourism the Environment and Your Community** the Importance to a community of environmental issues and practices like energy efficiency and water conservation cannot be underestimated, especially if tourism is a contributor to the local economy.

**Highly Educated Travelers** family and group vacationers select destinations primarily on-the-basis of cultural, gastronomic, wellness and other preferences; increasingly, they expect that the places they visit reflect their values on key issues like recycling practices, air and water quality, as well as the availability and quality of public transit. 

**The Logistics of Travel** are defined as:
 
_Anchoring stays_ in strategic locations along planned trip routes conveniently located to local points of interest and minimizing the number of accommodation changes; hence, fewer times packing and unpacking, thus lowering accommodations and transport costs in

_Hub and Spoke Locations_ smaller towns and rural communities with regional rail, bus, van, car and air connections strategically located within 200 or less miles of larger metropolitan areas 
_Sightseeing_, meals and other planned events in a hub and spoke fashion, saving time and money, but also an opportunity to slow down and enjoy the places and the people you are visiting

_Mode of Transport_ selections are a function of number of persons, trip length as well as the time of year you are traveling. Rationalizing travel movements, ascertaining transport mode(s) availability and costs are the key to a successful trip planning.

_Business Travelers_ require efficient plans to meet trip objectives. This may entail visiting several locations in a compressed period-of-time to seek investment and sales opportunities. They look to Main Streets shopping and entertainment venues, Historic Districts and other community neighborhoods that have or plan to put in place energy savings measures as well as other environmental safeguards that help reduce the cost of doing business in that local area. 

**A successful Destination** requires projects built around existing facilities that need upgrading and/or expansion to manage tourism flows and local production capabilities to enhance community offerings. Make Your Community a reference point for multiple overnight stays and for travelers who visit adjacent territories, with a focus on:

_Business_ events to market local, regional and global products and services;
_Vacation _offers built around families and small groups with an emphasis on culinary, wellness, historic preservation, cultural heritage and local typical products;

_Educational_ Tours seminars and professional enrichment itineraries designed for visiting tour operators and travel agents, community developers, sustainability officers and city managers, among others, help a community boost its tourism revenues while achieving it environmental objectives.
