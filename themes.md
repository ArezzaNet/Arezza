**Cultural Heritage and Local Museums** give meaning and purpose to the objects on display in museums and art galleries as they disclose the historical and archaeological heritage of a community, leverage conservation and the rediscovery of cultural heritage through the arts, history, archeology, literature and architecture, preserve biodiversity and rediscover cultures associated with agricultural, coastal and river communities.

**Local Food Wineries and Breweries** there are several fascinating examples throughout America of a resurgence in farming that cater to an ever-increasing demand for local, quality and sustainable food, wine and ale consumption in both urban and suburban communities, fueled in part by downtown development and neighborhood construction. This, in turn, has spawned a demand for nightlife and weekend amenities for local citizens and out of town visitors. Experience uniquely local atmospheres in American communities where many historical and sustainable attractions are also present.

**Public Transport Initiatives** In recent years, efficient and affordable public transit - in the form of bus rapid transit, subways, elevated and other rail services and trolley cars â€“ for urban, suburban and intercity service have been debated, studied and in some instances implemented. Our itineraries include major US cities with established commuter and regional service as well as communities that are implementing new transit programs. An opportunity to meet with local planners and managers and travel efficiently, safely and affordably as you visit the United States.

**Water Resources Management** and the Environment visit and study the efforts of communities that are in the forefront of water conservation and other environmentally sustainable practices in coastal and river waterfront development in small towns and large cities as well as agricultural communities. Local officials and nonprofit stewards of the environment, among others, will explain their policies, programs and best management practices in wastewater and watershed management, land conservancy issues, LEED certifications, recycling, rainwater collection and energy efficient systems.
