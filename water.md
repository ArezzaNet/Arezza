### _**Managing Water Resources in Resilient Communities**_

**Urban Flooding** many small towns lose drinking water because of aging pipes, in addition, asphalt and concrete prevent rainwater from soaking into the ground. The solution to inadequate storm water and drinking water management: green infrastructure like green roof, walls rain gardens and bios wales.
 
_**Aging Pipes and Outdated Systems Waste 14 percent of Daily Water Consumption**_

**Water Losses** from aging infrastructure and faulty metering lead to lost revenue for utilities and higher rates for water users. Also, increasing demand, maintenance and energy costs are responsible for a 90% increase in utility rates. This trend can be countered by best management practices BMP that include state-of-the-art audits, leak detection monitoring, targeted repairs and upgrades, pressure management, and better metering technologies.

_**Cost-effective Solutions for Homes Neighborhoods and Business**_

**Your Home** may be affected by water or sewage backup, basement seepage and flooding in your yard. A Full-Service Strategy comprises yard landscaping to manage storm water and increase property values. Coordinated Improvements are carried out by experts in landscaping, paving, plumbing, sewer and foundation repairs, waterproofing, gutters and downspouts.

**Your Neighborhood** flooding often affects multiple properties in a community, necessitating the participation of neighboring properties to improve local water management via risk mapping and low-cost flood reduction and mitigation.  Solutions include: downspout disconnection and drywells, rain gardens and tree planting on parkways. Affordable improvements also address cracked or blocked sewer pipes and flooding from nearby creeks and ditches.

**A Green Roof** consists of water-proofing, root repellent and drainage systems, filter cloth, a lightweight growing medium, and plants. This technology provides building owners a return on investment as well as significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. As each installation is unique, technical performance vary by region, climate, building, design, and type. Benefits include waste diversion, the use of recycled materials and extension of the service life of HVAC systems through decreased use.

**Storm Water Management** water is stored and then taken up by the plants from where it is returned to the atmosphere through transpiration and evaporation. Green roofs retain up to 90% of precipitation in the summer and 40% in winter, in the process moderating water temperature.

_**Green Roofs Reduce and Delay Storm Water Runoff Decreasing Stress on Sewer Systems**_

**Temperature Moderation** effects reduce demand on power plants, and potentially decrease the amount of CO2 and other polluting by-products being released into the air. Other green roof functions and uses include community gardens, commercial and recreational space.
